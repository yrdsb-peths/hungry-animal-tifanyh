**Objectif of game**
1. Collect as many apples as you can to increase score.
2. Avoid the bombs that decrease your score.
3. Avoid getting a score lower than zero.
4. Try to get your highest score!

**Special features added to Hungry Animal to increase difficulty**
1. Added a **enemy object** that falls down from the top similar to the blueberries. If the elephant touches the apple it losses one of the points it gained before from the apples.
2. Once the score goes bellow 0 due to the bombs or you miss a blueberry you will lose the game.
3. Once your score begins to increase the speed of the blueberries and enemies increase as well.
